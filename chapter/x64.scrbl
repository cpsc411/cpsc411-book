@title[#:tag "top" #:tag-prefix "chp1:"]{A Compiler Begins with a Language}

To me, the study of compilers is the study of languages.
As a mathematical object, a compiler is a transformation between languages,
transforming a source language into a target language---but that is for another
time.
As a program, a compiler is a function that takes any program in a @deftech{source
language} and produces some program that "behaves the same" in a @deftech{target
language}.

Before we can write our first compiler, we need to choose languages for the compiler.
We need a @tech{source language} and @tech{target language}.
Often, we choose a pre-existing target language.
Picking a target language is an interesting point in the design of any compiler.
We pick a target language shortly.
The source language, by contrast, is usually designed, often to achieve a
balance between aesthetic and pragmatic goals.
The rest of this course walks you through the design of a high-level
language with functional and imperative features that can be compiled
efficiently.

After we have picked our languages, we must write programs in the languages.
In fact, we must do more---we must write programs @emph{that write programs},
@ie we must write meta-programs.
We will write programs that validate, analyze, and transform programs.
We will write templates for programs, whole classes of programs.
That is the nature of a compiler.

But we do not want to jump straight into writing meta-programs.
That would be the sin of @emph{premature abstraction}, attempting to solve the
general problem before we understand how to solve a specific instance of the
problem.
We must learn to walk before we run.
We must write programs before we write meta-programs.

@section{Picking the target language}
Our first language is x86-64 plus @tech{system calls}, which we call
@deftech{x64} for short.
We'll start with a subset of this language and expand it slightly throughout the
course.
I elaborate on this language and what @tech{system calls} are shortly.

This is an unusual choice for a target language in a contemporary compiler.
Contemporary compilers often choose higher-level languages, such as C, LLVM, or
even JavaScript as target language.

There are good reasons to a choose higher-level language as a target language.
Often, a higher-level language provides more convenient abstractions, making
generating programs simpler.
The language may already have an efficient implementation, making writing
optimizations less important.
This frees the compiler writer to focus on the aesthetic goals of the new source
language.
Perhaps they want to focus on ruling out more errors statically, or providing
convenient syntax for certain programming patterns they find common.
These are common goals in source language and domain-specific language design.

However, choosing such languages as a target has a cost.
These targets come with their own implementation, their own compilers and
run-time systems.
If we want to use them, we commit ourselves to using their toolchains as well.
This may complicate our own development if it is difficult to setup those
toolchains.
Choosing a language also fixes an abstraction boundary---we cannot choose to
work at a level of abstraction lower than our target language.
This may prevent us from implementing certain functionality or optimizations.

For this course, we choose @tech{x64} for two main reasons.
First, for educational goals, we want to write transformations and optimizations
at some of the lowest abstraction layers we can.
Second, for pragmatic goals, it is significantly easier on the students (many)
to setup the toolchain for @tech{x64}, at a minor cost to the course staff (few)
who must maintain some @tech{x64} support code.
The second reason is a common rationale in compiler design---simplifying
something for the many users at the expense of the few compiler writers is
usually a good trade-off.

@section{Programming in x64}
Having chosen our target language, we must now understand the abstractions it
provides.
As far as we are concerned, the target language was not designed---it was
discovered@margin-note{Take a computer architecture course if you want to learn
how it was designed.}
It is the language of wild CPU found by geologists in cave somewhere, probably
in the Amazon.
It is primordial.
It is not sensible to ask questions like "why"---@tech{x64} @emph{is}.
And, because we want to talk to the CPU, we must deal with it.

While we have choosen @tech{x64} as our target language, @tech{x64} itself does
not run on most hardware.
Instead, it is the source language yet another compiler, which compiles
@tech{x64} to a binary machine code that I call @tech{bin64} for now.
In this course, we use the @tt{nasm} assembler to compile @tech{x64} into
@tech{bin64}.
The compiled programs can run natively on most hardware, but you may need an
interpreter depending on your machine.
@margin-note{Usually, interpreters for machine code are called "virtual machines".}

To get started with x64, let's consider the factorial function @racket[fact].
In Racket, following the design recipe, we would simply write:
@examples[
(code:comment "Natural Number -> Natural Number")
(code:comment "Takes a natural number n and returns the factorial of n.")
(code:comment "(fact 0) -> 1")
(code:comment "(fact 1) -> 1")
(code:comment "(fact 5) -> 120")
(define (fact n)
  (if (zero? n)
      1
      (* n (fact (sub1 n)))))
(eval:alts
(module+ test
  (require rackunit)
  (check-equal? (fact 0) 1)
  (check-equal? (fact 1) 1)
  (check-equal? (fact 5) 120))
(void))
(fact 5)
]
We run this and the computer prints @code{120}.

We can implement the equivalent computation in @tech{x64} as follows.
@margin-note{@tech{x64} actually supports at least two syntaxes. We use Intel
assembler syntax, as it maps more closely to familiar imperative language
syntax.}

fact_done:
;; Done. The result is in r9.

section .data ; The data section. This is where we declare initialized memory locations.

dummy: db 0
}

In this example, we compute the result, which is stored in @code{r9}.
Then, the machine happily tries to execute the next instruction in memory.
There is no next instruction, so it executes whatever happens to be in that
memory location.
The program hopefully crashes with a @tt{SEGFAULT} or @tt{SIGBUS} error, but
this depends on the operating system (@deftech{OS}).

This fact that the behavior depends on the OS is our first clue that this
example is not implemented in @emph{just} x86-64, the language of the CPU.
The meaning of the program, and thus the actual language in which we were
programming, depends critically on the @tech{OS}.

Each OS makes different assumptions about and enforce different restrictions
on the above example.
For example, the linker for each @tech{OS} assumes a different entry label for
where to start executing (although you can usually override this default).
The entry label is assumed to be "start" on macOS (at least, on some versions),
"_start" on Linux, and "Start" on Windows (depending on which Windows linker you
use).
On macOS, the @code{.data} section, which is used to declare initialized memory
locations, cannot be empty, and the linker rejects the program if it is.
In the above example, we don't actually use the heap, so we declare a dummy
value to ensure compatibility with macOS.
Most operating systems require that you explicitly "exit" the process, by calling
a special, operating-specific "exit" procedure at the end of the process.
Each OS defines a different set of these procedures, which we can think of as
the "standard library" for @tech{x64}.
This example is compatible with macOS, Linux, and Windows, as long as you
specify "start" as the entry label, and don't mind exiting with a bang.

Because of this critical dependence on the operating system, the target language
in this course cannot @emph{really} be "plain" @tech{x64}---@tech{x64} is a
family of programming languages, indexed by an operating system.
In this class, we never program the raw CPU---we program the operating system.
The CPU together with the operating system implements a different programming
language than the CPU by itself.
From a programming languages perspective, the operating system (@eg Linux) is
the run-time system for the OS-flavoured x64 programming language
(@eg @tech{x64-linux}).

In @tech{x64}, the result of the computation is not implicitly returned to the
user via the REPL like it is in Racket.
Instead, we have to explicitly say what the result is, and how to communicate it
to the user.
To do this, we need to use @deftech{system calls}, the procedures predefined by
the operating system that define @tech{x64} interacts with the operating system.

After compiling our @tech{x64} program with @tt{nasm}, we are left with program
in the first target language---a machine code binary, which is just about the
raw language of the CPU.
In fact, it is machine code in a binary format described by the OS, which
contains @tech{x64} instructions arranged according to the OS specification,
with additional boilerplate (often installed by the linker) to ensure correct
interoperation with the OS.
I call this target language @deftech{bin64}, and like @tech{x64}, it is a
family of languages.
As we rely on @tt{nasm} to generate @tech{bin64}, we do not study this target
language in any detail, any normally forget about it's existence except when
directing @tt{nasm} to generate the right language.

@margin-note{Take an operating systems course if you want to know more about how
to program the "raw" CPU to implement the "lowest" level of programming
language.
}
@margin-note{
Of course, a chip designer would really be implementing the "lowest"
level language by implementing the interpreter in raw silicon.
}
@margin-note{
Or, well, I guess the electrical engineer, who builds the transistors that the
chip designer uses, would be implementing the "lowest" language, which
implements an interpreter for binary gates in the language of raw, analogue
electrical signals.
}
@margin-note{
But what about the chemist who ... It's languages all the way
down!
}

@section{Flavours of x64}
Now that we know @tech{x64} is actually a family of languages, let us study the
different flavours of @tech{x64}.

In this course, the main difference between the flavours of @tech{x64} are in
the @tech{system calls}.
@tech{System calls} are @tech{x64} primitives provided by the OS.
Once we start using @tech{system calls}, code becomes OS-specific.
One of the first things a compiler writer will do is abstract away from
@tech{system calls}.
But to abstract away from them, we need to understand how they work in various
flavours of @tech{x64}.

Our earlier example @tech{x64} program was limited because we did not know how
to communicate.
In the rest of this section, we walk through how to use basic @tech{system
calls} to make a complete program that can exit properly and communicate its
result.
We will introduce further @tech{system calls} throughout this course.

@subsection{x64-linux}
In this course, @deftech{x64-linux} refers to the Linux-flavoured @tech{x64}.
This is @tech{x64}, using Linux @tech{system calls}, compiled to @tech{elf64}.
This version of @tech{x64} has few quirky restrictions and will be our
"default", the point of comparison for other flavours of @tech{x64}.

There are multiple system calls we could use to return a value to the system in
Linux.
For example, we could modify the program to return a value as an @tech{exit
code} through the @tt{exit} @tech{system call}.
In Linux, each process must call the @tt{exit} @tech{system call} to terminate
properly.
@tt{exit} takes an @deftech{exit code}, a number between 0 and 255, which is
passed to the parent process after the child process exits.
Usually, the @tech{exit code} indicates whether the process terminated normally
(0) or not (non-zero).
But we could just as well use it to return the value of factorial.

  mov r9, 1

fact_acc:
  cmp r8, 0
  je fact_done

  jmp fact_acc

fact_done:

  mov     rax, 60         ; I'm about to call the OS sys_exit function
  mov     rdi, r9         ; The exit code is the value from r9.
  syscall                 ; Perform the system call operation
}

Now, when @tt{fact} completes, we call the @tt{exit} system call.
This requires we set the register @tt{rax} to the value @tt{60} (in decimal),
which corresponds to the exit system call in Linux.
This system call expects one argument, the exit code, passed in register
@tt{rdi}.

In general, the Linux @tech{system call} interface uses the following calling
convention.
The @tech{system call} number is set in register @tt{rax}.
The arguments are set according to the System V AMD64 ABI.
The first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in register (in-order):
@tt{rdi}, @tt{rsi}, @tt{rdx}, @tt{rcx}, @tt{r8}, and @tt{r9}.
Remaining arguments are passed on the stack, although we will not use any
@tech{system calls} with more than six arguments.
We also won't be dealing with floating point arguments, which are passed in
separate registers.
For more details, Wikipedia is not a bad place to start:
@url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_calling_conventions#System_V_AMD64_ABI}.
But you could also go to the source: @url{https://github.com/hjl-tools/x86-psABI/wiki/x86-64-psABI-1.0.pdf}.

To compile this on Linux, we run @tt{nasm -f elf64 exit-fact-x64-linux.s -o
exit-fact-x64-linux.o}.
This will generate a binary in the @tech{elf64} target language.
The @deftech{elf64} is the Linux-flavoured @tech{bin64}, a binary format used on
Linux.
It includes the @tech{x64} instructions and additional structure that allows the
Linux operating system to control the binary.

Next, we link the file by running @tt{ld -e start -o exit-fact-x64-linux.exe
exit-fact-x64-linux.o}, which essentially connects the binary to the operating
system and any other external libraries, and specifies the entry point where
execution should begin (the @tt{start} label).
Now we can execute the file @tt{exit-fact-x64-linux.exe} on the command line
in the usual way, @eg set it to executable using @tt{chmod +x exit-fact-x64-linux.exe}
then execute with @tt{./exit-fact-x64-linux.exe}.
We can get the result of the exit code using @code{echo $?} or @code{echo
$status}, depending on your shell.

Most programming languages communicate their result by printing.
Thankfully, the OS does provide a print system call.
We could write the program below to print the answer instead of using the exit
status, to get a somewhat friendly user interface.

msg:   times len dw 0  ; A `len` length, in bytes, buffer, initialized to be full of 0.
}

To use the @tt{print} system call, we need to create a memory buffer to store
the message we wish to print.
We can statically allocate a buffer in the data section by creating a label,
@tt{msg:}, and using the @tt{times} keyword to allocate @tt{len} bytes
(indicated by @tt{dw}) of space, and initializing each to @tt{0}.
Then we call the print system call, number @tt{1}, specifying the standard
output port as the file to print to by setting @tt{rdi} to @tt{1},
specifying @tt{msg} as the address to print from in @tt{rsi}, and the length
of the buffer in @tt{rdx}.
When we run the program, it prints the expected result---@tt{x}.

@question{Why is @tt{x} the expected result instead of @tt{120}?}

@subsection{x64-macos}
macOS is very similar to Linux, and we can easily adapt the above examples to
macOS.
On macOS, there are 4 system call tables, computed by adding the system call
number to a specific prefix.
The BSD system call table, the most generic and Linux-like, uses the hex prefix
@code{#x2000000}.
The exit system call is system call 1 in the BSD table, so we use the system
call number @code{#x2000001}.
The example "exit-fact-x64-linux.s" from above is rewritten for macOS below.

To compile this file, we run @code{nasm -f macho64 exit-fact-x64-macos.s exit-fact-x64-macos.o}.
@code{macho64} is the binary formatted used by 64-bit macOS.
To link, we run @code{ld -macosx_version_min 10.6 -e start -o
exit-fact-x64-macos.exe exit-fact-x64-macos.o}.
We need to specify a minimum macOS version number of 10.6, otherwise the linker
will ignore the custom entry label and fail to link.
We can execute the file @code{exit-fact-x64-macos.exe} on the command line
in the usual way, and can get the result of the exit code using @code{echo $?}
or @code{echo $status}, depending on your shell.

macOS also has a similar write system call: number 4 in the BSD table.

@section{x64-windows}
Windows does not allow user processes to perform system calls.
Instead, we have to call kernel functions that provide similar functionality.
The @code{ExitProcess} kernel function provides the same functionality as the
exit system call on Linux and macOS.
However, making a function call is more complex than making a system call.
We have to declare external functions for the linker, and ensure we link with
the library that includes that function.

Windows also doesn't ship with a linker.

After downloading @code{nasm} and @code{GoLink}, you can compile using
@code{nasm -f win64 exit-fact-x64-windows.s -o

@title[#:tag "top" #:tag-prefix "chp2:"]{Abstract Locations}

@section{Preface: What's wrong with our language?}
In the last chapter, we designed our first language, @ch-bp-tech{Paren-x64 v1}, and
wrote our first compiler to implement it.
This language introduces the barest, although still very useful,
abstraction---freedom from boilerplate.
@ch-bp-tech{Paren-x64 v1} abstracts away from the boilerplate of @ch1-tech{x64}, and
details of exactly how to pass a value to the operating system.

While @ch-bp-tech{Paren-x64 v1} is an improvement of @ch1-tech{x64}, it has a
significant limitation for writing programs that we address in this chapter.
The language requires the programmer to manually manage a small number of
variables, namely the registers, while programming.
Human memory is much less reliable than computer memory, so we should
design languages that make the computer remember more and free the human to
remember less.
This will prevent the human from causing run-time errors when they inevitably
make a mistake and overwrite a register that was still in use.

To address this, we will introduce @tech{abstract locations}, of which there are
an arbitrary number and that the programmer does not need to know what
@tech{physical location} they end up using.

In general, these cannot all be mapped to registers, since there are a fixed
number of registers.
So to implement @tech{abstract locations}, we'll need to expose a little more
from our @ch1-tech{target language}.
We expose some limited access to memory in @ch1-tech{x64}, and introduce the
abstraction of a @tech{frame variable} to help use compile @tech{abstract
locations} to @tech{physical locations}.

We also need to design a new language, and some translations, that enable
instructions to work over @tech{abstract locations}, even though @ch1-tech{x64}
restricts which kinds of @tech{physical locations} instructions can use.

@section{Designing a Source language}
When designing a new abstraction, I often start by reading and writing some
programs using an existing abstraction until I spot a pattern I dislike.
@todo{Do some example Paren-x64 v1 programming}

We've seen a few @ch-bp-tech{Paren-x64 v1} programs by now, and they all have a
pattern: all computations act on a small set of 16 registers.
This limits the way we can write computations.
We must, manually, order and collapse sub-computations to keep the number of
registers that are in use small.
We must keep track of which registers are still in use before we move a value,
or we will overwrite part of our computation.

Furthermore, the instructions we're given are idiosyncratic---they only work
with certain operands, such as requiring some integer literals to be 32-bit or
64-bit, depending on which instruction we're using.
The programmer is forced to consider the size of their data before choosing how
to proceed with a computation.

These limitations make programming cumbersome and error-prone.

Instead, we should free the programmers (ourselves), eliminating cumbersomeness
and removing error-prone programming patterns.

We should free the programmer to invent new locations at will if it helps their
programming, and not worry about irrelevant machine-specific restrictions on
these locations.

We design a new language, @tech{Asm-lang v2}, to abstract away from these two
machine-specific concerns.

@bettergrammar*[asm-lang-v2]

The language no longer knows about registers, but instead presents an
@tech{abstract location} to the programmer.
There are two assembly instructions---move a value to an @tech{abstract
location}, or perform a binary operation on an @tech{abstract location}.
These now act uniformly on their arguments.
The left-hand-side is always the destination location, and the right-hand-side
is an arbitrary trivial value.

Our convention requires that we pass the result to the @ch1-tech{OS} in
@paren-x64-v1[rax], but we've removed registers from the language.
This requires us to design some new feature that we can use to indicate the
result without exposing registers, and that the compiler can identify in order
to compile to an instruction that sets @paren-x64-v1[rax].
We add the @asm-lang-v2[halt] instruction, which indicates the end of the
computation with a particular value as the result.

@section{Exposing Memory in Paren-x64}
@todo{Transition}

We first need to expose @ch1-tech{x64} features to access memory locations.
In particular, we expose @tech{displacement mode operands} for memory locations.
The @deftech{displacement mode operand} is a new operand that can appear in some location
positions as the operand of an instruction.
This allows accessing memory locations using pointer arithmetic.
It is written as @tt{QWORD [reg - int32]} or
@tt{QWORD [reg + int32]} in @ch1-tech{x64}, where @tt{reg} is a register
holding some memory address and the @tt{int32} is an offset number of bytes
from that address to access, as a 32-bit integer.
The keyword @tt{QWORD}, which is an unintuitive spelling of "8 bytes",
indicates that this operand is accessing 64 bits at a time.

@margin-note{
"Word" normally means the unit of addressing memory---64 bits in our case.
Unfortunately, in the past, the word size was different.
In order to avoid backwards incompatibilty changes, tools that use @tt{WORD} as
a keyword, like @tt{nasm}, didn't want to change it's meaning.
Instead, the keyword @tt{WORD} means 16 bits, not the word size, and prefixes
give us multiple of that notion of @tt{WORD}.
So @tt{QWORD} is 4 @tt{WORD}s, or 64 bits, which is the word size on x64.
}

For example, if @tt{rbp} holds a memory address, we can move the value
@tt{42} to that memory address using the instruction
@tt{mov QWORD [rbp - 0], 42}.
We can move the value from memory into the register @tt{rax} using the
instruction @tt{mov rax, QWORD [rbp - 0]}.

Note that a @tt{mov} instruction to an address can only move 32-bit integer
literals.
@tt{mov [rbp + 0], 9223372036854775807} is invalid; instead, the interger would
need to be moved into a register, first, as in:
@;
@verbatim{
mov r9, 9223372036854775807
mov [rbp + 0], r9
}

Our offsets are multiples of 8.
The offset is a number of bytes, and since we are dealing primarily with 64-bit
values, we increment pointers in multiples of 8.
For example, the following snippet of code moves two values into memory, then
pulls them out and adds them.
@verbatim{
mov QWORD [rbp - 0], 21
mov QWORD [rbp - 8], 21
mov rax, QWORD [rbp - 8]
mov rbx, QWORD [rbp - 0]
add rax, rbx
}

These accesses grow @emph{downwards}, subtracting from the base pointer rather
than adding, following common conventions about how stack memory is used.
This is an arbitrary choice, but we choose to follow the convention.

The new version of @deftech{Paren-x64 v2} (@racket[paren-x64-v2]) is below.

@bettergrammar*-ndiff[
#:labels ("Diff" "Paren-x64 v2" "Paren-x64 v1")
(paren-x64-v1 paren-x64-v2)
(paren-x64-v2)
(paren-x64-v1)
]

We add the new non-terminal @paren-x64-v2[addr] to the language, and add
@paren-x64-v2[addr] as a production to @paren-x64-v2[loc].
The @paren-x64-v2[addr] non-terminal represents a @tech{displacement mode
operand} to an instruction.
We abstract the language over the @deftech{base frame pointer}, the pointer to
the start of the current stack frame, which is stored in the parameter
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register] and is
@paren-x64-v2[#,(current-frame-base-pointer-register)] by default.
An @paren-x64-v2[addr] may only be used with the
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register] as its first operand.
The offset of each @paren-x64-v2[addr] is restricted to be an integer that is
divisible by 8, the number of bytes in a machine word in @ch1-tech{x64}.
This ensures all memory accesses are machine-word aligned, meaning we leave
space for all bytes in the word between each access.
Note that the offset is @emph{negative}; we access the stack backwards,
following the @ch1-tech{x64} "stack grows down" convention.
@todo{introduce this convention}

All languages in our compiler assume that the uses of
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register] obey the @deftech{stack discipline}, defined
below; all other uses are @ch-bp-tech{undefined behaviour}.
Setting its value directly is forbidden.
Pointer arithmetic, such as @paren-x64-v2[(set! rbp (+ rbp opand))], is allowed
only when the @paren-x64-v2[opand] is a @racket[dispoffset?].
Incrementing the pointer beyond its initial value given by the run-time system
is forbidden.
We do not try to enforce these statically, since it may be impossible to do so
in general.

@digression{
The language is parameterized by the @racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].
Parameterizing the language this way lets us avoid committing to particular
register choices, making the language inherently more machine and convention
agnostic.
This is helpful in designing a compiler with multiple machine backends.
A real compiler would want to support many machines, not just @ch1-tech{x64},
and parameterizing the language makes this simpler.
We could imagine retargeting a new operating system that uses a different stack
register, by changing the value of @racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register],
among other parameters.
If our language definitions were sufficiently parameterized, few if any compiler
passes would need to differ between target machines.
This language is not suffiently abstract yet, but using parameterized languages
in this way is a common tool we will use.
}

To use the stack, the run-time system must initialize
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].
On systems following the SYS V ABI, @paren-x64-v2[rsp] is initialized the @emph{end} of
the virtual memory space, so we can create a simple run-time system by
copying @paren-x64-v2[rsp] into
@paren-x64-v2[#,(current-frame-base-pointer-register)], and growing down from
there will access unused memory.

@margin-note*{
We provide such a run-time system in @racketmodname[cpsc411/2c-run-time].
The run-time system provides a default stack of size 8 megabytes.
This should be enough for now, but if it's not, you can use the
@racket[parameter?] @racket[current-stack-size] to increase it.

Our run-time system also prints the value of @paren-x64-v2[rax] to the
screen, instead of returning it via an exit code, and does the work of
converting numbers to ASCII strings.
The @racket[execute] function uses @racket[nasm-run/read] to parse printed
output into a Racket datum.
If you're interested in how this is done, you can read the definition of
@racket[wrap-x86-64-run-time].

We assume that this run-time system is used until we introduce data types, which
require additional run-time support.

@section{Abstracting the Machine}
Now that we have effectively unlimited @deftech{physical locations}---registers and
memory locations that can store values---on the machine, we
want to begin abstracting away from machine details.

The first thing we do is to abstract away from the @tech{displacement mode operand},
introducing an abstract notion of @deftech{frame variable}, a variable that is
located in a particular slot on the frame.
This lets the programmer stop worrying about details like which register
contains the frame base, and what the constraints on displacement mode
offset are.

We define @deftech{Paren-x64-fvars v2} (@racket[paren-x64-fvars-v2]) below.
@bettergrammar*-ndiff[
#:labels ("Diff" "Paren-x64-fvars-v2" "Paren-x64-v2")
(paren-x64-v2 paren-x64-fvars-v2)
(paren-x64-fvars-v2)
(paren-x64-v2)
]

We replace the @paren-x64-v2[addr], the @tech{displacement mode operand}, with
the abstraction of an @paren-x64-fvars-v2[fvar],
which represents a unique location on the frame, relative to the current value
of @racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].
These are written as the symbol @racket[fv] followed by a
number indicating the slot on the frame.
For example @paren-x64-fvars-v2[fv1] is the frame variables indicating the
first slot on the frame.
Frame variables are distinct from labels, alocs, and rlocs.
The number represents the index into the frame for the current function.

@todo{
The @share{a6-compiler-lib.rkt} defines a few helpers for working with frame
variables: @racket[fvar?], @racket[make-fvar], @racket[fvar->index], and
@racket[fvar->addr].
}

In @tech{Paren-x64-fvars v2}, it is still @ch-bp-tech{undefined behaviour} to
violate stack discipline when using
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(implement-fvars (p paren-x64-fvars-v2?))
         paren-x64-v2?]{
Compiles the @tech{Paren-x64-fvars v2} to @tech{Paren-x64 v2} by reifying
@paren-x64-fvars-v2[fvar]s into @tech{displacement mode operands}.
The pass should use @racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].
}
]

This is a useful step toward an abstract assembly language, but we're still
forced to remember odd restrictions on which kind of @tech{physical location}
each instruction takes as an operand.
Our instructions in @tech{Paren x64-v2} are restricted by @ch1-tech{x64}.
For example, binary operations must use a register as their first operand.

We can create a new language which allows the user to ignore the differences
between @tech{physical locations}, enabling @emph{any} instruction to work on
any kind of @tech{physical locations}.
This way, the language is responsible for managing these annoying details
instead of the programmer.

We do this by defining @deftech{Para-asm-lang v2} (@racket[para-asm-lang-v2]), a kind of
less finicky assembly language.
We can think of this language as @emph{para}meterized by the set of locations,
hence the name.

@bettergrammar*-ndiff[
#:labels ("Diff" "Para-asm-lang-v2" "Paren-x64-fvars-v2")
(paren-x64-fvars-v2 para-asm-lang-v2)
(para-asm-lang-v2)
(paren-x64-fvars-v2 )
]

The main difference is in the @para-asm-lang-v2[effect] non-terminal, which has
been renamed and simplified from the @paren-x64-fvars-v2[s] non-terminal.
Now, instructions can use an arbitrary kind of @para-asm-lang-v2[loc] as their
operands.
The semantics are otherwise unchanged.
@para-asm-lang-v2[(set! loc triv)] moves the value of @para-asm-lang-v2[triv] into
@para-asm-lang-v2[loc], and @para-asm-lang-v2[(set! loc_1 (+ loc_1 triv))] adds the
values of @para-asm-lang-v2[loc_1] and @para-asm-lang-v2[triv], storing the result in
@para-asm-lang-v2[loc_1].
Note that the two occurrences of @para-asm-lang-v2[loc_1] in a binary operations are
still required to be identical.
We're not trying to lift all restrictions from @ch1-tech{x64} yet.

We also add the @nested-asm-lang-v2[halt] instruction, which moves the value of
its operand into the @racket[current-return-value-register]
(@para-asm-lang-v2[#,(current-return-value-register)] by default).
Adding this abstraction frees the user from remembering which register is used for
this purpose.
This instruction is valid only as the final instruction executed in a program,
and it must be present.

Notice that two registers, @para-asm-lang-v2[r10], and @para-asm-lang-v2[r11], have been
removed from @para-asm-lang-v2[reg].
@tech{Para-asm-lang v2} assumes control of these registers, forbidding the
programmer from using them directly.
Instead, the language implementation will make use of this when compiling to
@tech{Paren-x64 v2}.
These auxiliary registers are defined by the parameter
@racket[current-auxiliary-registers].

Note that we do not have to restrict @para-asm-lang-v2[rax], despite the language
making use of it.
@question{Why not?}

@digression{
If we were trying to support multiple backends, we might parameterize the
language further by the set of unrestricted registers.
This set would describe the registers that can be used in an arbitrary way by
the program, and would exclude the set of @racket[current-auxiliary-registers].
Each restricted register would have some invariants associated with it, similar to
the @tech{stack discipline} invariant for the
@racket[current-frame-base-pointer-register].

@section{Nesting Instruction Sequences}
@todo{This is sort of crowbarred in. Really belongs in "imperative abstractions", which is all about composition. But that requires a lot of motivation in that chapter, and a lot of new typesetting.}
One of the most restrictive limitations in our language is that expressions
cannot be nested.
Each program must be a linear sequence of instructions.
@todo{motivation is weak here}
@todo{This is must easier to motivate, I think, when going top-down ala the
removing-patch-instructions branch.
select-instructions needs to transform one effect into multiple instruction in
effect context.}

We can easily lift this restriction by designing a language that supports
nesting, and compiling it using our well-known operations for composing
@tech{instruction sequences}.
This simplifies the job of later passes that are now free to nest instructions
if it's helpful.

Below, we design @deftech{nested-asm-lang-v2}.

@bettergrammar*-diff[para-asm-lang-v2 nested-asm-lang-v2]

We add a @para-asm-lang-v2[tail] production which loosely corresponds to the
top-level program from @tech{Para-asm-lang v2}.
However, these can be nested, before eventually ending in a @nested-asm-lang-v2[halt]
instruction.
The @nested-asm-lang-v2[tail] production represents the "tail", or last, computation
in the program.

We also enable nesting in effect position.
This essentially allows us to copy and paste some @ch-bp-tech{instruction
sequence} into the middle of a program.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(flatten-begins [p nested-asm-lang-v2]) para-asm-lang-v2]{
Flatten all nested @nested-asm-lang-v2[begin] expressions.
}
]

@section{Abstracting Physical Locations}
We are still required to think about @tech{physical locations}.
We don't usually care which location a value is stored in, so long as it is
stored @emph{somewhere}.

We can introduce an abstraction to capture this idea.
We define an @deftech{abstract location} to be a unique name for some
@tech{physical location}, that is unique for some unit of allocation (for
the moment, this means they're globally unique).
Each @tech{abstract location} must be allocated a @tech{physical location}
somewhere on the machine, and we want to ensure the allocater can replace any
two instances of an @tech{abstract location} with the same @tech{physical
location}.

We define @deftech{Asm-lang v2} (@racket[asm-lang-v2]) below.
@tech{Asm-lang v2} is an imperative, assembly-like language.

@bettergrammar*-ndiff[
#:labels ("Asm-lang-v2" "Diff" "Nested-asm-lang-v2")
(asm-lang-v2)
(nested-asm-lang-v2 asm-lang-v2)
(nested-asm-lang-v2)
]

In @tech{Asm-lang v2}, we generalize instructions to work over @tech{abstract
location}, @asm-lang-v2[aloc].
An @asm-lang-v2[aloc] is a symbol that is of the form @code{<name>.<number>},
such as @asm-lang-v2[x.2]; this is captured by the @racket[aloc?] predicate.
We assume all @asm-lang-v2[aloc]s are unique up to some scope, and any reference
to the same @asm-lang-v2[aloc] is to the same location---these are not the
@ch3-tech{names} yet.
So far, the only scope we have is the global program scope, so all
@tech{abstract locations} are globally unique.

Implementing @tech{Asm-lang v2} is a multi-step process.
We gather all the @tech{abstract locations}, then assign them to
@tech{physical locations}.
@todo{'Implementing' concretely means compiling to nested-asm v2 right?
This should probably be moved to the beginning of this section and
also be more elaborate.}

For each step, we create an @deftech{administrative language}---an intermediate
language whose semantics does not differ at all from its parent language, but
whose syntax is potentially decorated with additional data that simplifies the next
step of the compiler.
We represent this additional data in an @deftech{info field}, an annotation in
the program that serves only to store additional information for compilation.
This additional information is often the result of some program analysis or
preprocessing step that informs the next compiler pass.
In the parent language, @tech{Asm-lang v2} in this case, the @tech{info field}
is unrestricted---it could contain anything at all.
In fact, we can view the parent language as a family of languages, each
differing in its @tech{info field}.

@margin-note*{
The module @racketmodname[cpsc411/info-lib] provides utilities for working with
the @tech{info field} representation.
It also provides the contract @racket[info/c], which formalizes the
specification language for @tech{info fields}.
}

We represent the @tech{info field} as an association list of keys to a proper
list whose first element is the value of the key, such as @racket[((key
value))].
In general, we only give a partial specification---it may contain arbitrary
other key-value pairs.
This lax specification is useful for debugging: you may leave residual
@asm-lang-v2[info] from earlier languages, or include your own debugging
@asm-lang-v2[info].
The @asm-lang-v2[info] field is also unordered.

@digression{
In a production compiler, we would probably not represent these
@tech{administrative languages} at all, but instead store the contents of the
@tech{info field} "on the side", as a separate data structure.
This would prevent us from deconstructing and reconstructing the syntax tree
when modifying or accessing the @tech{info field}.

However, directly representing the @tech{info field} as part of the language has
some advantages.
It becomes simple to compose passes under a single interface.
The program representation captures @emph{all} of its invariants, and we do not
need to consider an external data structure, making debugging, printing, and
reading programs simpler.

Furthermore, our representation of the @tech{info field} is not
particularly efficient.
The proper list representation uses strictly more memory than necessary, and
does not support random access.
We could improve it by using improper lists, such as @racket[((key . value))], or
perhaps a a hash table.
However, this representation is simpler to read and write in program text.
}

First, we analyze the @tech{Asm-lang v2} to discover which
@tech{abstract locations} are in use.
This is a straight-forward analysis, traversing the program and collecting any
@tech{abstract location} we see into a set.

We define the @tech{administrative language} @deftech{Asm-lang v2/locals} (@racket[asm-lang-v2/locals])
(pronounced "Asm lang v2 with locals") to capture this information.

@bettergrammar*-diff[asm-lang-v2 asm-lang-v2/locals]

The only difference is in the @tech{info field}, which now contains a
@deftech{locals set}, a @racket[set?] of all @tech{abstract locations} used in
the associated @asm-lang-v2[tail].
A grammar production beginning with @racket[#:from-contract] is not specified
using BNF, but instead is specified by the @racket[contract] expression
following it.
In this case, the @tech{info field} is required to contain at least one entry
mapping the key @racket['locals] to a list of @racket[aloc?].
@margin-note*{
Contract expressions can be evaluated like predicates; see the documentation for
@racket[info/c] for examples.
}
In this language, there is an invariant that any @tech{abstract location} that
is used must appear in the @asm-lang-v2[locals] set in the @tech{info field}.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(uncover-locals (p asm-lang-v2?))
         asm-lang-v2/locals?]{
Compiles @tech{Asm-lang v2} to @tech{Asm-lang v2/locals}, analysing which
@tech{abstract locations} are used in the program and decorating the program with
the set of variables in an @tech{info field}.

@examples[#:eval sb
(uncover-locals
 '(module ()
   (begin
     (set! x.1 0)
     (halt x.1))))

(uncover-locals
 '(module ()
   (begin
     (set! x.1 0)
     (set! y.1 x.1)
     (set! y.1 (+ y.1 x.1))
     (halt y.1))))
]
}
]

Next, we assign homes for all the @tech{abstract locations}.
For now, our strategy is trivial: we assign each @tech{abstract location} a
fresh @tech{frame variable}.

We capture this information in a new @tech{info field}, described in
@deftech{Asm-lang-v2/assignments}.

@bettergrammar*-diff[asm-lang-v2/locals asm-lang-v2/assignments]

The @asm-lang-v2/assignments[assignment] @tech{info field} records a mapping
from each @tech{abstract location} to some @tech{physical location}.
The language is more general than our implementation strategy; we allow an
@tech{abstract location} to be assigned to any valid @tech{physical location},
including registers, to permit future optimizations or hand-written code.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(assign-fvars (p asm-lang-v2/locals?))
          asm-lang-v2/assignments?]{
Compiles @tech{Asm-lang v2/locals} to @tech{Asm-lang v2/assignments},
by assigning each @tech{abstract location} from the @asm-lang-v2/locals[locals]
@tech{info field} to a fresh @tech{frame variable}.

@examples[#:eval sb
(assign-fvars
 '(module
    ((locals (x.1)))
    (begin
      (set! x.1 0)
      (halt x.1))))

(assign-fvars
 '(module
    ((locals (x.1 y.1 w.1)))
    (begin
      (set! x.1 0)
      (set! y.1 x.1)
      (set! w.1 (+ w.1 y.1))
      (halt w.1))))
]
}
]

Finally, we simply replace all the @tech{abstract locations} with
the @tech{physical location} assigned by @racket[assign-fvars].

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(replace-locations (p asm-lang-v2/assignments?))
          nested-asm-lang-v2?]{
Compiles @tech{Asm-lang v2/assignments} to @tech{Nested-asm-lang v2},
replaced each @tech{abstract location} with its assigned @tech{physical
location} from the @asm-lang-v2/assignments[assignment] @tech{info field}.
}

@examples[#:eval sb
(replace-locations
  '(module ((locals (x.1)) (assignment ((x.1 rax))))
    (begin
      (set! x.1 0)
      (halt x.1))))

(replace-locations
  '(module ((locals (x.1 y.1 w.1))
            (assignment ((x.1 rax) (y.1 rbx) (w.1 r9))))
    (begin
      (set! x.1 0)
      (set! y.1 x.1)
      (set! w.1 (+ w.1 y.1))
      (halt w.1))))
]
]

As these three passes implement a single true language, we wrap them up as a
single pass.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(assign-homes (p asm-lang-v2?))
         nested-asm-lang-v2?]{
Compiles @tech{Asm-lang v2} to @tech{Nested-asm-lang v2}, replacing each
@tech{abstract location} with a @tech{physical location}.
}
]

@title[#:tag "top" #:tag-prefix "chp-boilerplate:"]{Abstracting Boilerplate (@emph{v1})}
In this chapter, we walk through the design of an entire @ch1-tech{compiler}.
It's a small one that merely abstracts some boilerplate, but it serves as a
concrete example of the entire process.

We will design our compilers by starting from a fixed abstraction boundary, an
existing @ch1-tech{target language}, and building a new layer of abstraction
atop it.
Our goal is to systematically design and build a new layer of abstraction,
formalized as a new programming language, a @deftech{source language}, that can
be implemented by translation into a corresponding @ch1-tech{target language}.
The new abstraction is meant to solve some problem, such as software development
being error-prone, software design being complex, or software produced in the
language being unsafe, unportable, or verbose.
Ideally, we solve this problem without introducing some cost, such as a high
learning curve, or some performance penalty.

To solve a problem, we must first concretely identify one, and then design
a layer of abstraction to address it.
Starting from the @ch1-tech{target language}, we ask a question:
@todo{Also talk about validators and undefined behaviour in this chapter. Should
that be separate from abstracting boilerplate?}

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
  What's wrong with this language?
}

Once we identify a concrete problem, we design a new @tech{source language} that
solves the problem, and then design a @ch1-tech{compiler} to transform the
@tech{source language} into the @ch1-tech{target language}.
The @tech{source language} in its definition should capture all there is to the
new abstraction.
Our goal is to faithfully implement the new abstraction in terms of the old one.

We aim to derive each @ch1-tech{compiler} from these language definitions,
letting the abstractions be our guide.
This is easiest when we focus on a single problem at a time, so we will
introduce many @deftech{intermediate languages} in the process---languages that
are both @tech[#:key "source language"]{source} and @ch1-tech{target languages},
serving some intermediate @ch1-tech{compilers}.
Each of these intermediate @ch1-tech{compilers} is more called a @deftech{compiler
pass} or just @deftech{pass}, while @ch1-tech{compiler} is reserved for the
transformation from a @tech{source language} in which a programmer writes
programs.
Each of our @tech[#:key "pass"]{passes} may be as simple as inserting some code,
or as complex as analyzing and rewriting the structure of many pieces of
interacting code.
While some of our @tech[#:key "pass"]{passes} are easily derived from our
language definitions, some have been designed after years of iteration to
effectively implement some well-known abstraction.
@todo{
Abstraction vs convention?

The abstraction we introduce to remove boilerplate is not a new syntactic form, but
a @deftech{convention}: a pattern programs in the language must follow to be
implemented correctly.

}
@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@emph{A note on conventions.} In each chapter, we incrementally design a whole
compiler.
Each subsequent design will be an iteration on the previous design.
To distinguish them, we include a version tag for each; the version tag in
this chapter is @emph{v1}.
Since our compilers are designed around languages, we include this version tag
in the language name, even if the set of features in the language does not
change from one chapter to the next.
For example, in this chapter, we design @tech{Paren-x64 v1}
(@racket[paren-x64-v1]), a subset of @ch1-tech{x64}.
This language will go through many iterations, and its version tag will change
with each.

This version tag is also used in the various support libraries that accompany
this book when support code must be sensitive to the compiler or language
versions.
For example, the reference implementations of the @emph{v1} languages are found
in the library @racketmodname[cpsc411/langs/v1], and the test suites for the
@emph{v1} compiler as in @racketmodname[cpsc411/test-suite/public/v1].

The tag is usually, but not necessarily, a number.
When a chapter does not change any interface at all, the version number may
remain the same with some additional suffix added to the tag, akin to semantic
versioning.
}
@section{Designing an Abstraction}
Our current abstraction boundary, @ie, our current language, is @ch1-tech{x64}.
So we start by asking: what's wrong with @ch1-tech{x64}?

There is a lot wrong with @ch1-tech{x64}, but we'll start with one problem that
many programmers are familiar with, and one that is simple to address:
boilerplate.
Writing programs in @ch1-tech{x64} requires the programmer to insert repetitive
boilerplate, such as the declaration of the initial label, and some code to exit
the program and report the result to the user.
This boilerplate prevents the user from focusing on the program and requires
them to copy and paste the same snippets of code into their programs, an
error-prone process if that snippet ever needs to change.

We could solve this problem by allowing the programmer to focus on writing and
composing sequences of instructions, by giving those sequences meaning
independent of the boilerplate and the run-time system.
For example, a programmer should be able to write two sequences, separately:
@verbatim{
;; Program 1
mov r9, 42
}

Somewhere, separately:
@verbatim{
;; Program 2
mov rax, r9
}

And, in our desired language, combining these would be well defined, such as in
the following example, without ever referring to the boilerplate requried by
@tt{nasm}.
@verbatim{
;; Program 3, by combining Program 1 and Program 2
mov r9, 42
mov rax, r9
}

@todo{Also, convention: rax contains the answer}
Our goal is to introduce this abstraction of @deftech{instruction sequences}:
lists of instructions that represent the code of an @ch1-tech{x64} program.
@tech{Instruction sequences} separate the code from the boilerplate.
As a result, we get a notion of program composition, allowing us to focus on the
program, and decompose a program into separate pieces that we can easily stitch
together.
Supposing @metavar{p_1} and @metavar{p_2} are both @tech{instruction sequences},
then there exists @racket[(p-append _p_1 _p_2)] (for some definition of
@racket[p-append]) which first executes the instructions in @metavar{p_1} and then
executes the instructions in @metavar{p_2}.

Below, we select the subset of @ch1-tech{x64} instructions we plan to suppport
in our @tech{compiler}, but note that the abstraction of @tech{instruction
sequences} applies to all @ch1-tech{x64} instructions.

@itemlist[

@item{@tt{mov @metavar{triv}, @metavar{triv}}

This string represents the move instruction, which moves a value from one
location to another, or moves a value into a locaction.

@ch1-tech{x64} imposes further restrictions on @tt{mov}
(remember---@ch1-tech{x64} @emph{is}, we must not ask why).
We can only move a value into a register, or a value in one register to another
register.
}

@item{@tt{add @metavar{triv}, @metavar{triv}}

This string represents the add instruction, which intuitively
adds two values.

In fact, we cannot add values in @ch1-tech{x64}: we can add a value (@ie an
integer), to a register @tt{add @metavar{reg}, @metavar{integer}}, or add the
values of two registers, @tt{add @metavar{reg_1}, @metavar{reg_2}}.

Furthermore, when using an integer directly in the add statement, it must be a
32-bit integer, in the range @tt{-2^31 <= i <= 2^31 - 1}.
Yes, that's right, 32-bit not 64-bit; we do not ask "why" of x64.
For example, @tt{add rax, 2147483647} is valid, but @tt{add rax, 2147483648} is
not.
Instead, we would first need to move @tt{2147483648} into a register to
add it to @tt{rax}.
For example:
@verbatim{
mov rbx, 2147483648
add rax, rbx
}
}
@item{@tt{imul @metavar{triv}, @metavar{triv}}

This string represents the multiply instruction, which intuitively
multiplies two values.

Multiplication is further restricted by @ch1-tech{x64}.
Again, we cannot multiply values directly.
We can only multiply the value of a register by a 32-bit integer @tt{imul
@metavar{reg_1}, @metavar{int32}}, or the value in a register by the value in
a register @tt{imul @metavar{reg_1}, @metavar{reg_2}}.
}
]

Below is an example of a valid @tech{instruction sequence} in our subset of
@ch1-tech{x64}.
@nested[#:style 'inset
@verbatim{
  mov rax, 170679
  mov rdi, rax
  add rdi, rdi
  mov rsp, rdi
  imul rsp, rsp
  mov rbx, 8991
}
]

Note that this does not correspond to a @ch1-tech{x64} @emph{program}, as it is
missing much of the structure: the starting label, the section declarations,
etc.
It has no meaning on its own in @tt{nasm}, and part of the job of our compiler
is to transform it so that it does have meaning when given to @tt{nasm}.
You probably have some idea of how to fix this program to have meaning, but we
will be systematic in our approach in defining its meaning.

We represent @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequences} as Racket strings, with
each instruction separated by newline characters.
For example, the @ch1-tech{x64} instruction sequence @tt{mov rax, 42}
corresponds to the Racket string @racket{  mov rax, 42}.

Note that this representation of @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequences} is
whitespace sensitive.@;, and is thus, not @tech{canonical}---two programs that
@;we wish to consider as the same have different representations.
For example, the following @tech{instruction sequence} is represented by both
the Racket string @racket{ mov rbx, 2147483648\n add rax, rbx} and
@racket{\nmov rbx, 2147483648\n\nadd rax, rbx\n}.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@verbatim{
  mov rbx, 2147483648
  add rax, rbx
}
]

This is one of the first problems we will solve, by moving away from
strings as a representation.

Before we can begin compiling, we need to define what an @tech{instruction
sequence} means, independent of how it is implemented.
Otherwise, we would not know whether we are compiling them correctly.

We address both of these problems next by designing a @tech{source language}
that captures the meaning of @tech{instruction sequences}, for our choosen
subset of @ch1-tech{x64}, and choosing a new representation of programs that we
will use for the rest of this book.
@;The final result of the @tech{instruction sequence} is the value of some
@;designated register after the last instruction is executed.
@;Note that this language definition combines a new abstraction, the
@;@tech{instruction sequence}, with a @tech{convention} for using the abstraction.

@section{Defining a Source Language}
Our next step is to capture this abstraction in its own language.

When defining languages, we start by defining their abstract syntax via an
eBNF grammar, such as the one below.
When we described @tech{instruction sequences}, we described them in terms of
the concrete syntax of @ch1-tech{x64} and strings, but this syntax is not
convenient for a compiler to manipulate.
Concrete syntax often contains irrelevant details that are useful for human
programmers, but irrelevant to a machine.
For example, strings are difficult to work with as they lack structure for
conveniently accessing substructures, and whitespace sensitivity means two
identical programs have multiple representations.

From now on, we'll work almost entirely in abstract syntax.
Our abstract syntax is meant to be represented as quasiquoted data, so the
expression @paren-x64-v1[(begin (set! rax 42))] is represented in Racket as
@racket[`(begin (set! rax 42))], or (equivalently) @racket[(list 'begin (list
'set! 'rax 42))].
See @secref["qq" #:doc '(lib "scribblings/guide/guide.scrbl")] for
more.

Below, we define a new language, @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, with our new
@tech{instruction sequence} abstraction.
We first present a simple definition of the abstract syntax, then gradually
refine the definition to encode more constraints.

@define-grammar[paren-x64-v1-simpl
  #:literals (integer?)
  #:datum-literals (begin set! + * rsp rbp rax rbx rcx rdx rsi rdi r8 r9 r10 r11
   r12 r13 r14 r15)
  [p (begin s ...)]
  [s (set! triv triv) (set! triv (binop triv triv))]
  [triv reg integer]
  [binop + *]
  [reg rsp rbp rax rbx rcx rdx rsi rdi r8 r9 r10 r11 r12 r13 r14 r15]
  [integer integer?]
]

Every @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program, @paren-x64-v1[p], begins with
@paren-x64-v1[begin], followed by a sequence of statements (instructions).
The non-terminal @paren-x64-v1[p] defines the @tech{instruction sequence}
abstraction.
We can define the composition operation as follows:
@racketblock[
(define (p-append p1 p2)
  (match `(,p1 ,p2)
    [`((begin ,s1 ...) (begin ,s2 ...))
     `(begin ,@s1 ,@s2)]))
]

Each instruction @paren-x64-v1[s] corresponds to one of the @ch1-tech{x64}
instructions described earlier.
For example, the @ch1-tech{x64} instruction @tt{mov @metavar{reg},
@metavar{integer}} corresponds to the @tech{Paren-x64 v1} instruction
@paren-x64-v1[(set! reg integer)].
Our abstract syntax makes more clear that the arithmetic operations are actually
a combination of an arithmetic operation and an operation that changes state.
The instruction @tt{add @metavar{reg}, @metavar{integer}} is represented
@paren-x64-v1[(set! reg (+ reg integer))].
Note that this duplicates the register in the syntax, and the two occurences
must be the same in order to correspond to a valid @ch1-tech{x64} instruction.

Some restrictions from @ch1-tech{x64} are not apparent in the definition of the
grammar.
To simplify precisely defining languages as grammars without too much additional
English specification, we create two extensions in our eBNF language.
@itemlist[

@item{Any time we suffix a non-terminal by an underscore and a number, such as
@paren-x64-v1[reg_1], this is a reference to a particular instance of a
non-terminal, and it is restricted to be identical to any other instance of the
same non-terminal with the same underscore suffix within the same expression.
So @paren-x64-v1[(set! reg_1 (+ reg_1 integer))] represents an
@tt{add} instruction in @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, and both occurrences of
@paren-x64-v1[reg_1] must be the same register.
However, two instances of non-terminals with different suffixes, like
@paren-x64-v1[reg_1] and @paren-x64-v1[reg_2], are not necessarily
different---they are only not guaranteed to be the same.
As usual in eBNF, any reference to a non-terminal without an underscore is also
unrestricted.
For example, in @paren-x64-v1[(set! reg reg)], neither occurrence of
@paren-x64-v1[reg] is guaranteed to be the same nor different.
}

@item{Any non-terminal that is not defined as syntax, such as
@paren-x64-v1[int64], may be defined by a Racket predicate, such as
@racket[int64?].
Such definitions link to the documentation defining the predicate.}
]

Using these two features, we define the final grammar of @deftech{Paren-x64 v1} (@racket[paren-x64-v1])
with all @ch1-tech{x64} restrictions as follows.

@margin-note{Since we are frequently extending and comparing languages, we
typeset them in a tabbed interface with one or more diffs comparing two
languages, and usually a tab containing the language definition on its own.
The diff emphasize what has been @bnf:add{added} to the language, and what has been
@bnf:sub{removed} from the language.
Anything that is unchanged between the two is left without additional
formatting.
}

(paren-x64-v1)
(paren-x64-v1-simpl paren-x64-v1)
(paren-x64-v1-simpl)
]


The predicates @racket[int64?] and @racket[int32?] are defined by the support
library @racketmodname[cpsc411/compiler-lib], and return @racket[#t] if and only
if given an integer in the range for a 64-bit or 32-bit, respectively, signed
two's complement integer.

@;subsection{Understanding Meaning}
A grammar is not enough to define our language.
When we create a new language, we want to ensure we understand the meaning of
that grammar separate from how it is compiled.
This is for two reasons.
First, optimizations depend on when various programs in a language are
equivalent.
We need to understand the language in order to understand when programs are
equivalent.
Second, we cannot know whether the compiler is correct if we do not know
the meaning of programs before they are compiled.
Unit tests will help us debug, but when we know the meaning of @emph{all}
programs in the language, we can say whether that meaning is preserved through
compilation.

We can define the meaning of a language by writing an interpreter.
For most of our languages, we assume the grammar has an interpreter that roughly
corresponds to embedding the program in Racket, although we describe in detail
any features that don't correspond closely to existing Racket features.
For some languages, including this first @tech{source language}, we walk through
the design of an interpreter explicitly.
@;other-doc['(lib "cpsc411/cpsc411.scrbl")]
@;FRAGILE LINK
@margin-note{
Reference implementations of all our languages are available the
@hyperlink["cpsc411/ref-langs.html"]{Language Reference Implementations}
}

Since @tech{Paren-x64 v1} is an imperative language and does not return values,
we must decide how to interpret a @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program as a value.
Unlike @ch1-tech{x64}, there is no preexisting @tech{convention} for how to produce a
value, so we must create our own.
We create a @deftech{convention}, or pattern that every program must follow to
be well-defined, for producing a final value in @tech{Paren-x64 v1} by
deciding that the final value is the value of @paren-x64-v1[rax] when the
program is finished executing (has no instructions in the @tech{instruction
sequence} left to execute), modulo 256.
This choice is completely up to us, but this choice is designed to continue to
work well as we build up our compiler.
We explain the modulo 256 later.
@todo{remove this}

Design an interpreter that produces the value of a @tech{Paren-x64 v1} is
straightforward.
We implement a register machine: a recursive function over @tech{instruction
sequences} that interprets each instruction using an accumulator mapping
registers to values.
When there are no instructions left, the interpreter returns the value of
@paren-x64-v1[rax], the register designated by our convention.

When we begin writing our interpreter, we will immediately notice an edge case.
What is a register has no value before it is used?
For example, what is the value of a program when @paren-x64-v1[rax] is never
initialized?

There are several ways to deal with this, but we take the simplest that will
enable us to efficiently compile @tech{Paren-x64 v1}:
we also require that any register is initialized before it is accessed.
We inherit this restriction from @ch1-tech{x64}.
In @ch1-tech{x64}, the value of an uninitialized register is undefined, that is,
accessing an uninitialized register results in @deftech{undefined behaviour},
behaviour that has no specified definition in the language specification.
Since we don't want to insert code to check every register is initialized (if
that's even possible, it would be expensive), or insert extra code to initialize
registers to arbitrary values (how would we distinguish them from real values?),
we simply restrict the language.

@tech{Undefined behaviour} is common in low-level languages that lack a strong
enough enforcement mechanism for checking assumptions.
Eliminating @tech{undefined behaviour} by adding static or dynamic checks in the
source language improves the ability of programmers to predict behaviour of all
programs in your language.
However, it is not always practical to achieve.
It may be too difficult to statically check an assumption and still allow all
the programs you want to allow, or too expensive to check a property
dynamically.
In these cases, we are forced to make assumptions that we cannot enforce,
injecting @tech{undefined behaviour} into our language.

In this book, we make it a non-negotiable goal: @tech{source languages} must
never have @tech{undefined behaviour}.
If they might, we (temporarily) sacrifice expressivity until we have enough
expressivity to remove the @tech{undefined behaviour}.
So in @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, there are no uninitialized registers.

In the interpreter, we @emph{assume} the input is a valid @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program.
Not only syntactically, but also obeying any restrictions or conventions
required by the language.
In a user interface, we would validate all input, but in the implementation of
the interpreter, we keep the two concerns separate.
Instead, the interpreter is free to assume all integers are in the right range,
arithmetic instructions correctly refer to the same register in both operand
positions, and all registers are initialized before use.
For example, in the instruction @paren-x64-v1[(set! reg_1 (+ reg_2 integer))],
we assume @paren-x64-v1[reg_1] and @paren-x64-v1[reg_2] are identical, and
@paren-x64-v1[integer] is a 32-bit integer, since otherwise the input would not
have been a valid @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program.
In fact, it would be bad style to check these again in the interpreter, since
this mixes concerns and duplicates code.


@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(interp-paren-x64 [x paren-x64-v1?]) int64?]{
Interprets the @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program, returning the final value as an exit code
in the range 0--255.
@;, returning the final value as a 64-bit signed integer.

@examples[#:eval eg
(interp-paren-x64
 '(begin
    (set! rax 0)
    (set! rax (+ rax 42))))

(interp-paren-x64

    (set! rdi rax)
    (set! rdi (+ rdi rdi))
    (set! rsp rdi)
    (set! rsp (* rsp rsp))
    (set! rbx 8991)))
]
}
]

To properly implement arithmetic operations, you need to handle two's complement
arithmetic, which overflows on large positive numbers and underflows on small
negative numbers.
You may want to use @racket[x64-add] and @racket[x64-mul] from
@racketmodname[cpsc411/compiler-lib].

Now we can begin designing a compiler.

@section{Enforcing Assumptions}
One of the jobs of the front-end of a compiler is to enforce assumptions the
rest of the compiler makes.
Enforcement mechanisms take various forms, such as parsers,
type checkers, linters, and static analyses.

We're going to design a function @racket[check-paren-x64] to validate
@tech{Paren-x64 v1} programs.
It is similar to a parser.
It reads an arbitrary value, expected to represent a @tech{Paren-x64 v1}
program, and returns a valid program in the language @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, or
raises an error.
However, it is a trivial parser.
Usually we think of parsers as transforming from one representation to another,
but this parser does not transform the representation of input if it is
valid---it only transforms the @emph{type}, or interpretation, of the data.
@;It does not deal with transforming strings into abstract syntax.
@;Instead, it expects its input to be abstract syntax already, and either returns
@;it if the abstract syntax is already valid, or raises an error.
@;This means our parsers, like the rest of our compiler, are simple tree automata,
@;rather than complex string automata.

You could view @racket[check-paren-x64] as a type checker.
In this view, it checks for a single type: @emph{The-Paren-x64-Type}, which
every valid instruction has, and which has quite simple typing rules.
@racket[check-paren-x64] checks that the input program is following the typing
disciplines of the language (which aren't very restrictive).

I'll call passes of this kind @deftech{validator}, a generic name for a compiler
passes that does not transform the representation of data, but does transform
the type or interpretation of that data.

Writing validators for intermediate language programs, including those produced
by your compiler, is a powerful debugging technique.
By designing them in the same way as @racket[check-paren-x64], so that they
return the input if it's valid, you can easily add them as passes in your
compiler and detect when an early pass produces an invalid program.
This is a form of @emph{property-based testing}, and will catch many more bugs
than unit testing alone.

To ensure no @tech{undefined behaviour}, our @tech{validator} should check the
following.
@itemlist[
@item{The input conforms to the grammar of @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, including
restrictions regarding the valid range of integers and when the same register
must appear in two places.}
@item{No register is referred to before is it initialized. We assume that no
register is initialized at the beginning of a program.}
@item{The register @paren-x64-v1[rax] is initialized before the end of the
program.}
]

We split this into two separate functions to enable separation of concerns.
We always want our syntax to be valid, but because @tech{Paren-x64 v1} will
serve as a target language, we may not always want to enforce that registers are
provabably initialized.
For example, the language may evolve to the point where checking this will be
undecidable, and source languages will be responsible for enforcing the guarantee
instead.
By separating the two checks, we'll be able to reuse code in this eventuality.

First, we check that the syntax is valid.

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@defproc[(check-paren-x64-syntax [x any/c]) paren-x64-v1?]{
Takes an arbitrary value and either returns it, if it is valid @tech{Paren-x64
v1} syntax, or raises an error with a descriptive error message.
}

@examples[#:eval eg
(check-paren-x64-syntax
 `(begin (set! rax ,(min-int 64))))

(eval:error
 (check-paren-x64-syntax
  `(begin (set! rax ,(- (min-int 64) 1)))))

(eval:error
 (check-paren-x64-syntax
  '(begin
     (set! r17 170679))))

(check-paren-x64-syntax
 '(begin
    (set! rax 170679)
    (set! rdi rax)
    (set! rdi (+ rdi rdi))
    (set! rsp rdi)
    (set! rsp (* rsp rsp))
    (set! rbx 8991)))
]}

Then, we check register initialization.
Note that this procedure can assume its input is well-formed @tech{Paren-x64
v1} syntax, and only concern itself with register initialization.

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@defproc[(check-paren-x64-init [x paren-x64-v1?]) paren-x64-v1?]{
Takes valid @tech{Paren-x64 v1} syntax, and returns a valid @tech{Paren-x64 v1}
program or raises an error with a descriptive error message.
}

@examples[#:eval eg
(eval:error
 (check-paren-x64-init
  '(set! (+ rax rdi) 42)))

(eval:error
 (check-paren-x64-init
  '(begin
     (set! (+ rax rdi) 42))))

(eval:error

}

In these examples, the reference implementation raises contract errors when the
input is invalid.
The reference implementation uses contracts on each and every pass to detect
invalid input and output.
These errors are separate from the errors raised by the validator.

For convenience, we define a single validator that validates all properties of
the language as @racket[check-paren-x64].

@nested[#:style 'inset]{
@defproc[(check-paren-x64 [x any/c]) paren-x64-v1?]{
Takes an arbitrary value and either returns it, if it is valid @tech{Paren-x64
v1} program, or raises an error with a descriptive error message. }
}

@section{Compiling}
Finally, we get to compiling.
We have designed our new abstraction, made it precise in the form of a language,
and enforced our assumptions.

The job of our compiler is to translate one level of abstraction into another.
We currently have three levels of abstraction: (1) @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, the
abstract syntax representation of @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequences},
(2) the string representation of @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequences},
and (3), @ch1-tech{x64} programs.
The structure of our compiler is determined partially by these levels of
abstractions, both the source layer and the target layer.
There are two pieces that need to be added to a @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program to
make it a complete @ch1-tech{x64} program: (1) boilerplate, such as the declaration
of the starting label and (2) the run-time system, which implements our
convention for the meaning of @tech{instruction sequences}.

We design our compiler as a series of compiler passes along these natural lines
in order to separate concerns as much as possible.
First, we translate from @tech{Paren-x64 v1} into the string representation of
@tech{instruction sequences}.
Then, we introduce the run-time system.
Finally, we wrap the whole thing in boilerplate.
This order is not arbitrary; it is dictated by our abstract layers.
Implementing the run-time system requires instructions outside the subset used
by @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, so we must reach a lower level of abstraction to
implement it.
However, it can be implemented as an @tech{instruction sequence}, and we want to
take advantage of @tech{instruction sequence} composition if we can.
We won't be able to do that after introducing boilerplate.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(generate-x64 [p paren-x64-v1?]) string?]{
Compiles a @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program into a @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction
sequence} represented as a string.

@examples[#:eval eg
(generate-x64
 '(begin
    (set! rax 0)
    (set! rax (+ rax 42))))

(require racket/pretty)
(pretty-display
 (generate-x64
  '(begin
     (set! rax 0)
     (set! rax (+ rax 42)))))

(pretty-display
 (generate-x64
  '(begin
     (set! rax 170679)
     (set! rdi rax)
     (set! rdi (+ rdi rdi))
     (set! rsp rdi)
     (set! rsp (* rsp rsp))
     (set! rbx 8991))))
]
}
]

@subsection{Implementing a Run-time System}
The abstractions provided by the operating system for running @ch1-tech{x64} are
not the same as the convention we just created for @tech{Paren-x64 v1}.
The operating system does not know it should "return" the result of
@racket[rax], whatever "return" means.
To implement this convention, we need to write some @ch1-tech{x64} code
(ideally, an @tech{instruction sequence}) that will take any @tech{instruction
sequence} implementing the @tech{Paren-x64 v1} convention and communicate the
result to the operating system.
This code is a very simple @tech{run-time system}.

The @deftech{run-time system} provides all run-time support required by the
language but that that is not provided by the underlying machine.
Exactly what this run-time support is depends on the language.
Typically, the language run-time provides memory allocation and deallocation,
initialization of the process environment such as the stack, handles returning
values to the user, and provides any built-in procedures that all programs in
the language can expect to use.
For @tech{Paren-x64 v1}, the only run-time support we require is returning the
final value to the operating system and exiting.

Our choice of run-time system depends on the abstractions provided by the
language, the machine, the operating system, and the user interface we desire.
Some languages print the final result.
Some languages discard the final result, relying on the user program to print
the result, or modify the filesystem, or modify the state of the machine (or the
world) in some other non-temporary way.

Our language does not provide the user with any way to observe the state of the
machine, so our run-time system must do the job of communicating the return
value to the user.

We could print the result, but as we saw in the factorial example above, the
operating system's definition of "print" does not match our intuition.
When trying to print "120", we get the character "x".
This would make for a very confusing user interface, or a very complicated
run-time system.

Instead, we opt for a very simple run-time system: communicate via the operating
system exit code.
This exit code is a number between 0 and 255 given to the exit system call, and
is easily accessible in shells via the variable @tt{$?} (or @tt{$status} in
some shells).
In Racket, we can access the exit code of a subprocess using
@racket[system/exit-code].
This limits how much our programs can communicate; we will lift that restriction
in later versions of our compiler.

Our run-time system is an @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequence} which
expects to be composed after another @tech{instruction sequence}.
The run-time system assumes that the first @tech{instruction sequence} must
initialize @paren-x64-v1[rax].
The run-time system then calls the @tt{exit} system call with the value of
@paren-x64-v1[rax] passed as the exit code.
@racketmodname[cpsc411/compiler-lib] provides some definitions, such as
@racket[sys-exit], that are helpful for this.

For formatting strings in Racket, you may want to investigate @racket[format],
@racket[~a], and @racketmodname[at-exp].

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(wrap-x64-run-time [x string?]) string?]{
Installs the @tech{Paren-x64 v1} run-time system.
The input is the same as the output for @racket[generate-x64]: a
string representing an @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequence}.
The run-time system is composed with the input as a second @tech{instruction
sequence}.

Note that in the string representation, string concatenation implements
@tech{instruction sequence} composition.
}]

@subsection{Implementing Instruction Sequences}

Finally, we implement a simple pass to turn the @tech{instruction sequence} into
a program, by introducing the @ch1-tech{x64} boilerplate described in
@Secref[#:tag-prefixes '("chp1:")]{top}.

@nested[#:style 'inset
@defproc[(wrap-x64-boilerplate [x string?]) string?]{
Takes an @ch1-tech{x64} @tech{instruction sequence} and wraps it with the necessary
boilerplate to return a complete @ch1-tech{x64} program in Intel syntax.
}]

After that, we have a complete compiler.
The compiler is easily defined by composing all the individual passes.
@racketblock[
(define (paren-x64-v1-compiler x)
  (wrap-x64-boilerplate (wrap-x64-run-time (generate-x64 x))))

(define paren-x64-v1-compiler^
  (compose wrap-x64-boilerplate wrap-x64-run-time generate-x64))
]

@examples[#:eval eg
(interp-paren-x64
 '(begin
    (set! rax 170679)
    (set! rdi rax)
    (set! rdi (+ rdi rdi))
    (set! rsp rdi)
    (set! rsp (* rsp rsp))
    (set! rbx 8991)))

(current-pass-list
 (list
  check-paren-x64
  generate-x64
  wrap-x64-run-time
  wrap-x64-boilerplate))

(execute
 '(begin
    (set! rax 170679)
    (set! rdi rax)
    (set! rdi (+ rdi rdi))
    (set! rsp rdi)
    (set! rsp (* rsp rsp))
    (set! rbx 8991))
  nasm-run/exit-code)
]

The support library @racketmodname[cpsc411/compiler-lib] provides a few
abstractions for deriving the compiler from a list of passes.
See @racket[current-pass-list], @racket[compile], and @racket[execute].

@section{Is the Compiler Correct?}
Now that we have a compiler the meaning of all our languages is fully defined.
We have an interpreter for the source language to define its meaning.
We have an "interpreter" for the target language (the CPU).
So we can define what it means for a compiler to be correct.

A compiler for @tech{Paren-x64 v1} is correct if:
@itemlist[
@item{the meaning (as defined by the interpreter) of a program @paren-x64-v1[p] is
the value @paren-x64-v1[integer_1]}
@item{we compile @paren-x64-v1[p] and execute it as a @ch1-tech{x64} program and
get the value @paren-x64-v1[integer_2]}
@item{the values @paren-x64-v1[integer_1] and @paren-x64-v1[integer_2] are
@emph{equivalent}. In general, we have to define equivalence for each pair of
source and target languages. In this case, the interpreter and the compiler
should return @emph{the same} value.
}
]

Instead of defining @tech{Paren-x64 v1} to produce a value modulo 256, we could
have instead defined its meaning as the final value of @paren-x64-v1[rax], and
then defined @emph{equivalence} between @tech{Paren-x64 v1} and @ch1-tech{x64}
differently.
In that case, the interpreter and compiled programs would produce different
results for some programs, but they would always be equivalent modulo 256.

This gives us yet another design choice in our compiler: do we restrict the
definition of our source language to ensure the compiler is correct, or design a
more complex equivalence relation that can decide whether the compiler is correct?
We won't spend much more time on this, and in general, choose to ensure the
interpreter and compiler produce "the same" value.

@todo{Cross-language equivalence}
@;Because we've chosen to return the result as an exit code, our definition for
@;compiler correctness is non-trivial.
@;The meaning of a @tech{Paren-x64 v1} program is a 64-bit integer, but we've
@;designed the compiler to only ever return a value between 0 and 255.
@;This doesn't mean our compiler is incorrect, but instead, our definition of
@;correctness uses a custom notion of equivalence.
@;For this compiler, the result of a @tech{Paren-x64 v1} is considered
@;@emph{equivalent} to the exit code returned by a @ch1-tech{x64} program when the
@;two are @emph{equal} up to modulo 256:
@;@racketblock[
@;(define (v1-results-equivalent? s t)
@;  (= (modulo s 256) t))
@;]

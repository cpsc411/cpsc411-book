@section{Assignment Summary}

The goal of this assignment is to introduce the idea of designing languages by
abstracting away from annoying details, and implementing those abstractions by
compilation.
We will (1) abstract away from imperative instructions on locations to
expressions on values, and (2) abstract away from a small number of physical
locations and replace them with an essentially unboundedly large number of
abstract names.

This assignment is due @(due 'a2).

You can use the interrogator to get limited access to the reference solution:

@;      locations on the machine.  For now, all abstract locations will be

@;      arbitrary size provided by the run-time system.  With access to memory,
@;      the number of physical locations becomes large enough to be practically

@section{Reading}
The reading for this week is @Secref[#:tag-prefixes '("book:" "chp2:")]{top} and
@Secref[#:tag-prefixes '("book:" "chp3:")]{top}.
As usual, this milestone description links to the documentation for each
exercise in the chapter for convenience, but you are responsible for the
reading the entire chapter.

You should read first and work the relevant exercises as you read.

@section{Exercises}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[uniquify] to resolve all @ch3-tech{names} to
@ch2-tech{abstract locations}.

You may find the functions @racket[name?] and @racket[fresh] helpful.
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[sequentialize-let].}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[normalize-bind].}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[select-instructions] to compile
imperative operations to abstract assembly instructions.

You may find the functions @racket[aloc?] helpful and @racket[fresh] helpful.
}

@exercise{Implement @racket[assign-homes].}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[uncover-locals] to analyze which
@ch2-tech{abstract locations} need to be assigned @ch2-tech{physical locations}.

You may find the function @racket[aloc?] helpful.
For working with sets, you may want to use @secref["sets" #:doc '(lib
"scribblings/reference/reference.scrbl")].
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[assign-fvars] assign @ch2-tech{abstract
locations} to @ch2-tech{physical location}.
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[replace-locations] to replace
@ch2-tech{abstract locations} with their assigned @ch2-tech{physical location}.
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[flatten-begins] to flatten nested
instructions.

You may find the function @racket[make-begin] helpful.
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[patch-instructions] to abstract away from
@ch1-tech{x64} restrictions.
}

@exercise{Design and implement @racket[implement-fvars] to support the
@ch2-tech{frame variables} abstraction.

You may find the function @racket[fvar->index] helpful.
}

@exercise{Extend @racket[generate-x64] to emit @ch2-tech{displacement mode operands}.
@todo{Add hint for nasm syntax?}
}

@exercise{Remove your definitions of @racket[wrap-x64-boilerplate] and
@racket[wrap-x64-run-time].
These are now provided by @racketmodname[cpsc411/2c-run-time], since your
run-time system is getting more complicated.
}

@exercise{
Which passes were simplified by the ability to nest @asm-lang-v2[tail]s?
}

@subsection{Optional Exercises}

These exercises are optional, but if you complete them, you'll be able to use
them when debugging your compiler, by comparing the results of a compiled
program to the result of interpreting it.

@todo{Add a separate chapter on validator, interpreters, etc, their use in
intermediate languages, and source langauges.}

@exercise{Redesign and extend the implementation of @racket[check-paren-x64].
You should be able to modify your validator for the previous
@ch-bp-tech{Paren-x64 v1} to include cases for displacement mode
operands and accept programs for @ch2-tech{Paren-x64 v2}.

You should start by writing new examples and tests for the new specification,
and adding new @racket[match] clauses following the template.
}

@exercise{Redesign and extend your implementation of @racket[interp-paren-x64]
to support @ch2-tech{Paren-x64 v2}.

@;You should start by writing new examples and tests for the new specification,
@;and adding new @racket[match] clauses following the template.
@;You'll need at least 4 new tests, checking for success and failure of the new
@;features.

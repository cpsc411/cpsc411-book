@title{COVID Syllabus Addendum}
This page includes changes to the syllabus specifically to deal with the
COVID-19 panedmic.

@section{Goal}
My primary goal this semester is to teach you all some cool, hard stuff about
compilation and software engineering, while prioritizing a safe, healthy, and
relatively low-stress learning environment.
I will prioritize health at the expense of some learning objectives and
evaluation if necessary.
I will try to make decisions early, without waiting on UBC policy, to reduce the
anxiety of uncertainty.
I may make changes in the interest of health above and beyond what UBC requires.

You should feel free to contact me if you have concerns about COVID and course
policy.

@section{Changes to Lecture Delivery}
Lectures will be delivered online via Zoom until at least Jan. 24th, per UBC policy.

Our scheduled lecture hall, DMP 110, has an occupancy limit of 120.
At the current enrolment (67 students), 50% occupancy of DMP 110 is @emph{almost} possible.
This, combined with effective masking and good ventilation, should enable a relatively safe lecture environment.
However, I may decide to change to exclusively online delivery at any point.

IF YOU ARE SICK, DO NOT COME TO CLASS. Doesn't matter if it's COVID or not.

All lectures will be recorded; this is meant to enable students who are ill or
exposed to COVID to isolate.
However, you are strongly advised to attend lectures synchronously when it is
safe for you to do so.
Students who rely entirely on recorded lectures tend to do worse than students
who attend synchronously, as they are unable to ask clarifying questions and may
fall behind and be unable catch up.

I will post all lecture materials, including code and slides, after each
lecture.
I may also post additional lecture notes.
However, the online book already contains most of what we will cover in the
course.

If lectures are in person, masks are required (including over your nose), and I
strongly recommend all students upgrade to respirator-type fitted masks.
N95s are orders of magntitude (~1000x) more effective than cloth masks at
filtration, and can be safely reused for approximately 200 days according to the
N95 rating.
They are composed of both fibers and fiber glass that has been electrically
charged to attract and trap tiny particles.
They should not be washed or exposed to high heat, as this can destroy the
charge, but they should be allowed to dry between uses; I setup a
rotation of 7 that I reuse weekly.
They're pretty easy to find online, e.g.,
@url{https://unitedcanadainc.com/product/3m-aura-disposable-particulate-respirator-9205-n95/}
or @url{https://shop.vitacore.ca/}.
I have a few I can hand out.
You should look up how to put on and fit test such a mask, e.g., @url{https://youtu.be/RcI7vbTzPlk?t=624}.

@section{Changes to Office Hours}
Office hours will be online via Zoom until at least Jan. 24th.
Office hours may remain online after that, at the discretion of the TAs and instructors.

If office hours are in person, masks are required (including over your nose),
occupancy will be limited, and I strongly recommend students upgrade to
respirator type masks.
See above for details.

@section{Changes to Evaluation}
The midterm and final exam structure and method of delivery (either in-person or
online) may change, or be canceled entirely, at any point, at the instructor's
discretion.
Please don't ask.

The exams may be either coding exams on computer similar in structure to the
project, or multiple choice exams on paper or delivered via Canvas.

If the midterm is canceled, the weight will be shifted to the final exam.
If the final exam is canceled, the weight will be shifted to the project.
If you miss the midterm and it is not canceled, your weight will be shifted to
the final.
If you miss the final and it is not canceled, you must apply for a deferred
standing and you will at a later point be given a different final exam to
complete, or will you fail the course.

The project deadline is not until the end of the semester, so there are no
extensions.
Plan ahead, and expect to get sick at some point during the semester.

@section{Accommodations and Accessibility}
If you require, or think you might require, any accomodations, you should reach
out to the Centre for Accessibility immediately.
I am unable to handle accomodation requests on my own, and may need
documentation and support from the Centre, which may take time.
Without documentation from the Centre, you are expected to follow all course
policy including rules in this syllabus without exception.
